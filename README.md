# Glaucoma Detection Using Deep Learning

This project aims to detect glaucoma from retinal fundus images using deep learning. Leveraging transfer learning with state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the pipeline enhances model accuracy through data augmentation and class balancing.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `Glaucoma Detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook implementing the full pipeline.
- 
- `README.md`: Project overview and setup instructions.

## üß† Models Used

1. **MobileNetV2**
   - Lightweight and efficient
   - Ideal for mobile and edge deployment
   - Fine-tuned with custom dense layers

2. **DenseNet**
   - Dense connections to encourage feature reuse
   - Reduces the vanishing gradient problem
   - Fewer parameters than traditional deep CNNs

3. **Xception**
   - Uses depthwise separable convolutions
   - Performs better on high-resolution images
   - Advanced architecture based on Inception modules

## üîÑ Pipeline Overview

1. **Data Loading**
   - Fundus images with glaucoma labels

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Resize and normalize images
   - Augmentation: rotation, flip, zoom, brightness adjustment
   - Class balancing (oversampling minority class)

3. **Model Building**
   - Load pretrained base model (MobileNetV2, DenseNet, or Xception)
   - Add GlobalAveragePooling, Dropout, and Dense layers
   - Compile with Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy

4. **Training & Evaluation**
   - Visualize training history (accuracy/loss curves)
   - Use validation split to monitor overfitting
   - Generate classification metrics (e.g., confusion matrix, precision, recall)
